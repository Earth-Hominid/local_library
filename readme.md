A library website built using Express, taken from The Mozilla Developer Network tutorial.

See the live demo [here](https://secret-crag-48856.herokuapp.com/).

## Description

This tutorial focuses on building a back-end for a fictitious library's website. The application is architected using the Model-View-Controller pattern.

NodeJS's runtime engine along with the Express framework is used to build the Web-Server, while MongoDB is utilized to construct the database.

Both the "Models" and "Controllers" have been built to handle the author, the book itself, the genre of the book, and the instance of the book.

The "Views" have been constructed using the PUG templating language.
