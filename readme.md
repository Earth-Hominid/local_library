# Online Library | MDN's NodeJS & Express Tutorial

A library website built using Express, taken from The Mozilla Developer Network tutorial.

## Description

This tutorial focuses on building a back-end for a fictitious library's website. The Model, View, Controller methodology is implemented in architecting the application.

The web-server is built with NodeJS's runtime engine along with the Express framework, while the database is constructed with MongoDB.

Both the "Models" and "Controllers" have been built to handle the author, the book itself, the genre of the book, and the instance of the book.

The "Views" have been constructed using the PUG templating language.
